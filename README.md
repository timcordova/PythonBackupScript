# Readme for this "TrueCrypt, SpiderOak" backup script

Created this backup script in Python some years ago to shutdown a TrueCrypt daemon if running, and copy the container over to a SpiderOak
location. 

The SpiderOak UI is being utlized to backup the destination location to save the TrueCrypt Container.

I understand that TrueCrypt was abandoned, and may or may not have some issues, but SpiderOak is still solid and this script could
be utlized for other type of movement using the FolderandFileLoc configuration file.
